# JavaRoulette
Much like minesweeper, but the user doesn't know where the bombs are.

### The Game
The game involves a board of a square size (specified by the user) for an amount of players (1 or more, also givem
by the user) alternating turns clicking buttons. Each button is either safe or a mine at random. If the user clicks on
a bomb tile, that player is "dead" and out of the game. The last person to click a good tile wins. The game ends in a
draw if all tiles are used or if the last player dies by clicking a bomb.

### Installing and Running the Game
You can install the game simply by downloading the repository, and copying the file JavaRoulette.jar to a folder of your
choice, ort by downloading the file directly: [JavaRoulette.jar](JavaRoulette.jar).

In both cases, to run the game, use the command ```java -jar <path-to-jarfile>JavaRoulette.jar```. Then fill out the
information as prompted. Your game will begin once all required input is collected.
